# Simple python snake game

This python file cintains a simple snake game. 
You will need to install pygame by using `pip install pygame`
before running. The apple will Give one point upon collision,
and the speedup will give none.
The speedup increases the game speed for 3 seconds, and will only appear once in
every 5 times you eat an apple. Combos are possible, as the speedup will remain visible 
when you eat it.
May add 3 points for speedup or an extra fruit, etc.
